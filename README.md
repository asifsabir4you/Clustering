# Clustering 

implementation of K-mean and fuzzy c-mean clustering. <br>
for k-mean I first implemented the clustering based on year or other single features and then based on all of them (you can see a visualization of the clustering based on the year the car was made bellow), cost function is also ploted and inner and outer distance is also calculated. just for the comparison k-mean clustering is done using sklearn as well. <br>

the link for the formula behind fuzzy c-mean clustering is available in the file itself.
